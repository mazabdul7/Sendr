# Sendr

This is the complementary model update web-application that is used alongside my third-year-project and is written by me. Sendr features a security-heavy design philosophy to ensure model updates are pushed to the Jetson Nano with ease and security.  
  
To run please first install the dependencies required from requirements.txt. The app is then run by running app.py. If running on a local server (to send files to Nano), the site address is not the one given by the terminal when running the app but is the local ip address of your host machine.
